  <p style="font-size: 1.1em;">ðŸ”· <strong>TEQx Token â€” Logic-Linked Utility for Identity-Based Assets</strong></p>

  <p>
    TEQx is a specialized utility token within the TEQNet ecosystem that enables logic-governed behavior across tokenized identities, credentials, and asset-linked metadata. While the TEQ coin powers the core network and governance, TEQx is used to support structured, permissioned functionality at the token level â€” where compliance, identity, and access control intersect.
  </p>

  <p>
    TEQx is designed to operate as a token logic layer, allowing approved issuers to define how a token behaves over time or under specific conditions. This may include lifecycle constraints, permissioned access, compliance assertions, or modular behavioral rules â€” without disclosing sensitive identity data or internal logic on-chain.
  </p>

  <p>
    The token is not speculative or freely transferable. Instead, it is purpose-bound, issued in coordination with identity or asset tokens, and often scoped to specific sessions, events, or regulatory roles. TEQx enables organizations and developers to build advanced functionality around credentials, IoT devices, certifications, and more â€” all within a privacy-conscious framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    As TEQNet expands, TEQx will serve as a trusted utility standard for activating token behavior, integrating with compliance systems, and enabling modular, policy-aware infrastructure across Web3 and enterprise ecosystems.
